# School Database

Educational fullstack web app for a schoolâ€™s database, with differing pages depending on the users role within the school.

## Details

The school database, despite it's name, is not only a database but also a web app for that database. The web app has different pages per school role, and each page has it's own functionality. Administrators can create teachers/classes and enroll students into the school, and view all teachers, classes, and students a part of the database. Teachers can view the students in their classes, their grades, and filter those students by grade and city they are from. Students can enroll in a class and update their information.
